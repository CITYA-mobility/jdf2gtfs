# jdf2gtfs
## Convert Czech or Slovak bus timetable data from JDF format into GTFS format

Public transport timetable data are the base of analytics in public transport. In the Czech Republic there are data available in the JDF format. This data cannot be directly used for analysis and data-mining. We have created an application for automatic processing of public transport timetables in JDF format. Thanks to Python, PostgreSQL and PostGIS technologies, our application can convert data to spatial database and GTFS format, which is the world standard for timetables data. The application is an open source software and provide data for analysis and optimization of public transport â€“ use of these data is in fields of identify places and times of delays, optimizing the capacity of vehicles and design network of routes.
